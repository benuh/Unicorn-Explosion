== Audio

A game's immersiveness increases as more and more media is added to it, and we decided that audio would be an interesting addition. Within the scope of this project, we decided that we would aim for basic sound effects, rather than trying to implement a full soundtrack. Rather than implementing a sample playback system, which has been successfully implemented on FPGA, we decided instead to aim for more of the CPU driven audio style typical of the 1980's video game. We felt that this would both be an interesting programming challenge and a stylistically appropriate choice.

== History of Computer Audio

CPU driven audio is a term retroactively applied to the earliest forms of computer audio, dating back before the use of dedicated audio hardware. The earliest home computers would be equipped with simple speakers, but since every audio element had to be driven from the CPU's main (and only) thread, the sounds they generated were limited to beeps and clicks. Later machines began implementing FM synthesis and sample playback to enhance audio quality, but we decided to stick to the basics. 

== Digital Audio and the Square Wave

The fundamental idea behind any digital logic circuit, particularly the FPGA, is that everything in a computer is binary. Audio, at least, the kind the people listen to, is fundamentally analog, so without some analog circuitry to convert ones and zeroes generated by the FPGA into continuous-amplitude waveforms, it seems impossible to generate an analog signal. However, the workaround used by early computer interface designers, and the method we adopted, was to simply pass the digital output through an amplifier and interpret the digital signal directly as audio. By switching back and forth between 1 and 0 on the output port, we found that we could generate a square wave and, with come calculations, make sure that it sat within the audible range. Then, by connecting a speaker of suitably low power requirements, we could directly output simple audio. As the Nexys 4 DDR board used for the project has a headphone jack soldered onto it, it appeared that this portion of the project would be relatively straighforward.

== Sound Design

We decided that there would be two important sound effects in the game, one of which being the sound when the player character jumped, and the other when the character died. Taking some inspiration from the Super Mario games, some of the pioneers in block jumping, we decided that the audio should be played as a rising tone to imply a jump, and a falling tone to imply failure. This could be implemented behaviorally in Verilog with little difficulty. We simply calculated out the number of clock cycles for the audio to be the right frequency at the start of the sound and stored this in a register. The system tracked time in a seperate counter, and waited for the counter to match the predetermined value. When a match occured, the timer was reset, the audio was flipped, and the register to hold the period of the audio tone was modified to change the tone for the next cycle. By trying out a few values, we settled on a suitable rate of rising and falling for the audio stream.

== Hardware Limitations

Upon synthesizing our initial implementation we were initially met with only a DC pop in response to our input, rather than the square waves we had programmed. After some research, we found that the audio system implemented on the Nexys 4 wasn't as simple as we had expected. Rather than simply running the FPGA audio through an isolator and into an amplifier, the board uses a system to transmit analog voltages via Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM. Through use of an analog filter, it converts the duty cycle of the waveform to analog voltage. This seems like a great workaround for the problem of outputting analog audio from a digital circuit, but it rest of our work useless without some kind of workaround.

=== Pulse Width Modulation

Pulse width modulation is a method of associating analog levels with the percentage of the time that a digital signal is equal to one, compared to the overall period. Converting it requires some kind of filter, but this is often not part of the circuit. In the case of an LED, our eyes simply see the rapidly flickering light as being dimmer, rather than flickering, achieving the effect of a dimmable LED. For systems like an electric motor, the motor itself is the filter, as it cannot start and stop instantaneously. However, for audio, the filtering must be a part of the circuit, like the one shown above. In the case of this particular board, it simply integrates the last handful of levels into an analog voltage, as seen in the following diagrams.

Since our board was designed to look at pulse width modulated audio in the megahertz range, our audio in the kilohertz range was unable to trigger the circuitry. To get around this, we implemented a simple modulating circuit to convert our generated square waves directly into pulse width modulated audio, to achieve the same type of sound as if we had driven the output directly. 

== Implementation

Our modulator took the generated audio stream as an input, and used the FPGA's 100 MHz clock as a timing reference. Once every 16 clock cycles, the circuit pulls the audio stream down to 0 for one clock cycle, passed the rest of the audio straight through for the next 14 cycles, then on the 16th cycle, it pulls the stream up to high. The resulting bitstream is 0000_0000_0000_0001 when the audio stream is at zero, and 0111_1111_1111_1111 when the audio stream is high. In this way, the square wave passes through nearly unchanged, but still goes through the amplification system allowing us to hear the audio without any external circuitry.
